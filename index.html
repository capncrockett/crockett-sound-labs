    <h1>Capturing sound is an art form.</h1>
    <p>
      At Crockett Sound Labs, my goal is to capture the “sound in your head.”
      With years of experience recording everything from classic jazz and blues
      to heavy metal, I have the knowledge and skills necessary to make your
      music sound its best.
    </p>
    <h2>Sound Engineering Options</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Home and Mobile Recording: I can come to you! Record a project at your
        rehearsal space or in the comfort of your own home; a far cheaper option
        than booking a studio.
      </li>
      <li>Live Recording: Got a live show you want captured? I can help.</li>
      <li>Studio Recording: When only the best will do.</li>
      <li>
        Mixing: Got raw tracks that need mixing? Home recordings that don’t
        sound quite right? Want to polish up old recordings or records? In
        addition to recording, I can work with you to bring out more of what you
        want to hear in any project.
      </li>
      <li>
        Live Sound: In need of a PA and someone to run it? Mics, stands, etc.
        I’ve got you covered.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Listen to My Work</h2>
    <p>
      The songs in the player are all projects I’ve had a hand in producing.
